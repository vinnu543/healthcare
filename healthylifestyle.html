        <h3>Healthy living facts:</h3>
        <p>This article is designed to give tips to readers about how they can improve or augment actions in their life to have a healthy lifestyle; it is not meant to be all inclusive but will include major components that are considered to be parts of a lifestyle that lead to good health. In addition to the tips about what people should do for healthy living, the article will mention some of the tips about avoiding actions (the don'ts) that lead to unhealthy living.
            
            "Healthy living" to most people means both physical and mental health are in balance or functioning well together in a person. In many instances, physical and mental health are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one directly affects the other. Consequently, some of the tips will include suggestions for emotional and mental "healthy living."</p>

                          <p>All humans have to eat food for growth and maintenance of a healthy body, but we humans have different requirements as infants, children (kids), teenagers, young adults, adults, and seniors. For example, infants may require feeding every four hours until they gradually age and begin to take in more solid foods. Eventually they develop into the more normal pattern of eating three times per day as young kids. However, as most parents know, kids, teenagers, and young adults often snack between meals. Snacking is often not limited to these age groups because adults and seniors often do the same.</p>

                                      <li>Eat three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner); it is important to remember that dinner does not have to be the largest meal.</li>
                                      <li>The bulk of food consumption should consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products.</li>
                                      <li>Choose lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts (with emphasis on beans and nuts).</li>
                                      <li>Choose foods that are low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars; look at the labels because the first listed items on the labels comprise the highest concentrations of ingredients.</li>
                                      <li>Control portion sizes; eat the smallest portion that can satisfy hunger and then stop eating.</li>
                                      <li>Snacks are OK in moderation and should consist of items like fruit, whole grains, or nuts to satisfy hunger and not cause excessive weight gain</li>
                                      <li>Avoid sodas and sugar-enhanced drinks because of the excessive calories in the sodas and sugar drinks; diet drinks may not be a good choice as they make some people hungrier and increase food consumption.</li>
                                      <li>Avoid eating a large meal before sleeping to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and weight gain.</li>
                                      <li>If a person is angry or depressed, eating will not solve these situations and may make the underlying problems worse.</li>
                                      <li>Avoid rewarding children with sugary snacks; such a pattern may become a lifelong habit for people.</li>
                                      <li>Avoid heavy meals in the summer months, especially during hot days.</li>
                                      <li>A vegetarian lifestyle has been promoted for a healthy lifestyle and weight loss; vegetarians should check with their physicians to be sure they are getting enough vitamins, minerals, and iron in their food.</li>
                                      <li>Cooking foods (above 165 F) destroys most harmful bacteria and other pathogens; if you choose to eat uncooked foods like fruits or vegetables, they should be thoroughly washed with running treated (safe to drink) tap water right before eating.</li>
                                      <li>Avoid eating raw or undercooked meats of any type.</li>

                        <p>Set a date for quitting. If possible, plan to have a friend quit smoking with you. It's best to pick a day within the next month. A date too far off in the future will give you a chance to procrastinate and postpone, while a date too soon may not allow you to make a plan for medications or support systems.
                            Notice when and why you smoke. Try to find the things in your daily life that you often do while smoking (such as drinking your morning cup of coffee or driving a car).
                            Change your smoking routines: Keep your cigarettes in a different place. Smoke with your other hand. Don't do anything else when you are smoking. Think about how you feel when you smoke.

                                      <p>Quitting smoking can re-wire your brain and help break the cycle of addiction. The large number of nicotine receptors in your brain will return to normal levels after about a month of being quit.</p>

                          <p>Physical activity and exercise is a major contributor to a healthy lifestyle; people are made to use their bodies, and disuse leads to unhealthy living. Unhealthy living may manifest itself in obesity, weakness, lack of endurance, and overall poor health that may foster disease development.</p>
                          <p>Physical activity is movement that is carried out by the skeletal muscles that requires energy. In other words, any movement one does is actually physical activity. Exercise, however, is planned, structured, repetitive and intentional movement intended to improve or maintain physical fitness</p>

                                      <li>Regular exercise can prevent and reverse age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength, improve balance, flexibility, and endurance, and decrease the risk of falls in the elderly. Regular exercise can help prevent coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Regular, weight-bearing exercise can also help prevent osteoporosis by building bone strength.</li>
                                      <li>Regular exercise can help chronic arthritis sufferers improve their capacity to perform daily activities such as driving, climbing stairs, and opening jars.</li>
                                      <li>Regular exercise can help increase self-esteem and self-confidence, decrease stress and anxiety, enhance mood, and improve general mental health.</li>
                                      <li>Regular exercise can help control weight gain and in some people cause loss of fat.</li>
                                      <li>Thirty minutes of modest exercise (walking is OK) at least three to five days a week is recommended, but the greatest health benefits come from exercising most days of the week.</li>
                                      <li>Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions.</li>
                                      <li>Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury or excessive soreness or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day.</li>
                                      <li>People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance with exercise.</li>
                                      <li>Almost any type of exercise (resistance, water aerobics, walking, swimming, weights, yoga, and many others) is helpful for everybody.</li>
                                      <li>Sports for children may provide excellent opportunities for exercise, but care must be taken not to overdo certain exercises (for example, throwing too many pitches in baseball may harm a joint like the elbow or shoulder).</li>
                                      <li>Children need exercise; play outside of the home is a good beginning.</li>
                                      <li>Exertion during strenuous exercise may make a person tired and sore, but if pain occurs, stop the exercise until the pain source is discovered; the person may need to seek medical help and advice about continuation of such exercise.</li>
